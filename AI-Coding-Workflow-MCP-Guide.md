## Introduction

This guide outlines a repeatable, structured process for working with AI coding assistants to build production-quality software. The methodology combines traditional software development best practices with the revolutionary capabilities of Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling AI assistants to interact seamlessly with your entire development environment.

## Core Principles for AI Coding

### Golden Rules

1. **Planning Before Coding**: Always have a conversation with the LLM to plan initial scope and tasks
2. **Structured Documentation**: Maintain `PLANNING.md` for scope and `TASK.md` for specific tasks
3. **Global Rules Enforcement**: Use project-level rules to ensure consistency across all AI interactions
4. **Modular Architecture**: Never create files longer than 500 lines of code
5. **Test-Driven Development**: Always create unit tests for new features
6. **Continuous Documentation**: Update README.md when features, dependencies, or setup changes

### AI IDE Support

Modern AI coding assistants support global and project-level rules:

- **Cursor Rules**: [Context rules documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai)
- **Windsurf Rules**: [Memory management](https://docs.codeium.com/windsurf/memories#windsurfrules)
- **Cline Rules**: [Prompting best practices](https://docs.cline.bot/improving-your-prompting-skills/prompting)
- **Roo Code Rules**: Works similarly to Cline

## Understanding Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic in late 2024 that enables AI assistants to interact with external tools, data sources, and services through a unified interface. Unlike traditional approaches that require custom integrations for each tool, MCP provides a standardized way for AI models to discover and use capabilities dynamically.

### Key Benefits

- **True Tool Integration**: AI assistants can directly interact with Git, run tests, manage issues, and more
- **Memory & Context Management**: Maintains knowledge across sessions, creating "project memory"
- **Security & Control**: Isolates credentials and requires explicit approval for interactions
- **Dynamic Discovery**: AI can discover available tools and adapt to new servers at runtime

### MCP Architecture

```

```

MCP servers act as intermediaries that expose specific capabilities through standardized interfaces, allowing any MCP-compatible AI assistant to use them.

## Setting Up Global Rules

### Example Global Rules Configuration

```markdown
### ðŸ”„ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `PLANNING.md`** at the start of new conversations
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting tasks
- **Use consistent naming conventions** as described in planning docs

### ðŸ§± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create files longer than 500 lines**
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**
- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages)

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Reliability
- **Always create Pytest unit tests** for new features
- **Update existing tests** when logic changes
- **Tests should live in `/tests` folder** mirroring app structure
- Include: expected use, edge case, and failure case tests

### âœ… Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks** in `TASK.md` immediately
- **Add discovered sub-tasks** to "Discovered During Work" section

### ðŸ“Ž Style & Conventions
- **Use Python** as primary language
- **Follow PEP8** with type hints and `black` formatting
- **Use `pydantic`** for data validation
- **Write docstrings** for every function using Google style

### ðŸ§  AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context** - ask questions if uncertain
- **Never hallucinate libraries** - only use verified packages
- **Always confirm file paths** exist before referencing
- **Never delete existing code** unless explicitly instructed
```

## Project Structure and Documentation

### Essential Files

1. **PLANNING.md**: Project architecture, goals, style, and constraints
2. **TASK.md**: Current tasks with descriptions and dates
3. **README.md**: Setup instructions, dependencies, and feature documentation
4. **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies
5. **.env.example**: Environment variable template

### Example Project Structure

```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ PLANNING.md
â”œâ”€â”€ TASK.md
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.example
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_main.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ test_services/
â””â”€â”€ docs/
```

## The Complete Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Project Initialization

1. **Create project structure** with essential documentation files
2. **Define scope** in PLANNING.md
3. **List initial tasks** in TASK.md
4. **Set up global rules** in your AI IDE

### Phase 2: Initial Development Prompt

The first prompt is crucial. Include:

- **Detailed requirements** with specific examples
- **Reference documentation** (use @docs for external docs)
- **Similar examples** of what you want to build
- **Technical constraints** and preferences

Example prompt structure:
```
Use @docs:model-context-protocol-docs and @docs:supabase-docs to create an MCP server 
written in Python (using FastMCP) to interact with a Supabase database.

The server should use Stdio transport and have these tools:
- Read rows in a table
- Create records in a table  
- Update records in a table
- Delete records in a table

Include comprehensive descriptions for each tool. Environment variables needed:
SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.

Reference: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/tree/main

After creating the server, update README.md and TASK.md.
```

### Phase 3: Iterative Development

1. **Single task focus**: Give one task at a time for consistent results
2. **File-specific changes**: Have LLM focus on updating single files when possible
3. **Documentation updates**: Always update README.md, PLANNING.md, and TASK.md after changes
4. **Regular testing**: Write or update unit tests for each feature

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance

1. **Code review**: Review generated code for security and best practices
2. **Test coverage**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
3. **Documentation review**: Verify all documentation is current and accurate

## Best Practices for Prompting

### Effective Prompting Strategies

1. **Be specific and detailed** in requirements
2. **Provide positive and negative examples**
3. **Request step-by-step reasoning** for complex tasks
4. **Use XML tags** for structured output when needed
5. **Specify desired length and format**

### Good vs Bad Examples

**Good Prompt:**
```
Update the user authentication function to include rate limiting with a maximum 
of 5 attempts per minute per IP address. Use Redis for storage and return 
appropriate HTTP status codes.
```

**Bad Prompt:**
```
Fix the authentication, add rate limiting, update the database schema, 
refactor the API endpoints, and write new tests for everything.
```

### Conversation Management

- **Restart conversations** when they get long (LLM starts making errors)
- **Maintain context** through documentation files
- **Ask clarifying questions** rather than making assumptions

## Testing Strategy

### Testing Requirements

Every feature must include:
1. **Expected use case test**
2. **Edge case test**  
3. **Failure case test**

### Test Organization

```python
def test_user_creation_success():
    """Test successful user creation with valid data."""
    # Expected use case
    
def test_user_creation_duplicate_email():
    """Test user creation fails with duplicate email."""
    # Edge case
    
def test_user_creation_invalid_data():
    """Test user creation fails with invalid input."""
    # Failure case
```

### Testing Best Practices

- **Mirror app structure** in test directory
- **Use descriptive test names** that explain the scenario
- **Test both happy path and error conditions**
- **Update tests** when logic changes
- **Mock external dependencies** appropriately

## Containerization and Deployment

### Docker Configuration

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["python", "server.py"]
```

### Build Commands

```bash
docker build -t mcp/supabase .
docker run -p 8000:8000 mcp/supabase
```

### Deployment Considerations

- **Use Docker** for consistent deployment across platforms
- **Environment variables** for configuration
- **Health checks** for monitoring
- **Logging** for debugging and monitoring
